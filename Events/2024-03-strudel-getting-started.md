### Description

STRUDEL is an open-source science project building resources to enable teams to plan, design, and build user-centered software for their scientific communities. STRUDEL is developing two key products. First, a Planning Framework to make it easier to identify and consider UX and sustainability concerns when planning new applications or features. Second, an extensible Design System for implementing usable web interfaces.

Join us virtually for the second in STRUDELâ€™s series of events. This hour-long webinar will explore details of the STRUDEL project and help you get started using our new Design System. Follow along with our live, interactive demo to learn how to go from an initial idea for a feature in your scientific software to leveraging the design system to stand up a web-based user interface.
