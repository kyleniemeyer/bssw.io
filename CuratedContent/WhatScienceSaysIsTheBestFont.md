Video | The Best Fonts, According to Science
Presenter | [SciShow YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SciShow)

This SciShow channel video goes into a number of research studies on the "best" fonts for various situations.
While the video **does not** go into the specific topic of fonts used for software development tasks (there is [another article](https://realpython.com/coding-font/) that does though), it does address fonts for people with various vision imparements.
In general, results from studies cited indicate that sans serif fonts such as [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial) do better though in some situations the measured differences are marginal.
From an inclusivity perspective, two key takeaways are that italics are particularly challenging for readers with dyslexia and that greater spacing between letters in a font may be the biggest factor in improving readability for all readers.
