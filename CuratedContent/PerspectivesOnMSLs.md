In his presentation, Matt Sottile, a CS researcher in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing ([CASC](https://computing.llnl.gov/casc)), offers some fresh perspectives on memory safe languages (MSLs).
He explains why he thinks they are gaining traction as well as why the software community is likely better positioned to consider migration strategies today than in years past.
He shares not only success stories but also why there is a lot of skepticism, justifiable or not.
He explains why a national DOE lab, like [LLNL](https://computing.llnl.gov), should care about MSLs and offers perspectives on how not only LLNL but the broader scientific software community may want to consider preparing for an eventual migration to MSLs.

One of the drivers for this presentation and discussion was the recent [RFI by the US Federal Government](https://bssw.io/items/us-federal-government-effort-to-champion-adoption-of-memory-safe-languages) regarding memory safe languages.
